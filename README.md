# Exploring Trends in California's Homeless Population

This project explores relationships between homelessness and possible contributing factors in California. The analysis considers demographic characteristics, housing, education level, unemployment, weather, and vocational rehabilitation in relation to homelessness across all California Continuums of Care (CoC).

Data was sourced from the California Open Data Portal, State of California Employment Development Department Data Library, US Census Bureau (American Community Survey), and National Centers for Environmental Information. All data source files can be found in the **resources** folders.  

Python script for each factor can be found in following Juypter notebook files:
